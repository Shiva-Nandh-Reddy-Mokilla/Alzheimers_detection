## Overview
This project involves analyzing data and performing various operations using Python within a Jupyter Notebook. The focus of the project is to implement advanced data processing and machine learning techniques using libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, and others. The notebook demonstrates step-by-step approaches to data exploration, preprocessing, model building, evaluation, and visualization.

## Installation
1. Ensure you have Python 3.12 or above installed.
2. Set up a virtual environment using pipenv:
    bash
    pipenv install
    pipenv shell
    
3. Install the required dependencies by running:
    bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
4. If the project involves datasets or additional files, ensure they are placed in the appropriate directories specified in the notebook.

## How to Run
To execute the Jupyter Notebook, follow these steps:

1. Activate your virtual environment:
    bash
    pipenv shell
    
2. Launch Jupyter Notebook:
    bash
    jupyter notebook Major\ Project.ipynb
    
3. Open the notebook in your browser and run the cells sequentially.

## Process and Methods
The notebook contains the following major sections:

### Data Loading and Exploration
- *Description*: Loads the dataset(s) and performs initial exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure, distribution, and relationships in the data.
- *Key Methods*: pandas.read_csv, pandas.DataFrame.describe, matplotlib.pyplot.hist.

### Data Preprocessing
- *Description*: Handles missing values, encodes categorical data, scales numerical features, and performs feature engineering.
- *Key Methods*: SimpleImputer, LabelEncoder, StandardScaler, and custom transformations.

### Feature Selection
- *Description*: Selects the most important features using statistical methods or machine learning techniques.
- *Key Methods*: SelectKBest, chi2, f_classif.

### Model Building
- *Description*: Implements machine learning models for classification or regression tasks using scikit-learn.
- *Key Methods*: LogisticRegression, RandomForestClassifier, train_test_split.

### Model Evaluation
- *Description*: Evaluates models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.
- *Key Methods*: confusion_matrix, classification_report, roc_auc_score.

### Visualization
- *Description*: Visualizes data distributions, correlations, and model performance using libraries like matplotlib and seaborn.
- *Key Methods*: sns.heatmap, plt.bar, sns.pairplot.

## Test Case Files
The following test cases ensure the reliability and accuracy of the implemented functions:

- *test_data_loading.py*: Ensures datasets are loaded correctly with the expected structure.
- *test_preprocessing.py*: Validates data preprocessing steps, including handling missing values and scaling.
- *test_feature_selection.py*: Checks feature selection methods for correctness.
- *test_model_training.py*: Confirms models are trained with the expected parameters and datasets.
- *test_model_evaluation.py*: Validates evaluation metrics and ensures the correct implementation of performance measurements.

## Assumptions and Known Bugs

### Assumptions
- The input dataset(s) are clean and follow a standard structure (e.g., CSV format with headers).
- All necessary dependencies are installed and compatible with Python 3.12.
- Visualizations assume standard plotting libraries (matplotlib, seaborn) and standard configurations.

### Known Bugs
- *Data Processing*: Handling of highly imbalanced datasets might require additional techniques such as oversampling or SMOTE, which are not implemented.
- *Feature Selection*: Some statistical methods may not work well with non-numeric data without preprocessing.
- *Visualization*: Large datasets can cause performance issues or make visualizations cluttered.
- *Compatibility*: Some functions may not work correctly with older versions of scikit-learn or pandas.
